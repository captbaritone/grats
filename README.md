# Grats: Implementation-First GraphQL for TypeScript

[![Join our Discord!](https://img.shields.io/discord/1089650710796320868?logo=discord)](https://capt.dev/grats-chat)

_Beta Software: Grats is largely stable and being used in production in multiple places. If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to let us know._

**The simplest way to build a GraphQL server in TypeScript**

When you write your GraphQL server in TypeScript, your fields and resolvers
are _already_ annotated with type information. _Grats leverages your existing
type annotations to automatically extract an executable GraphQL schema from your
generic TypeScript resolver code._

By making your TypeScript implementation the source of truth, you never have to
worry about validating that your implementation matches your schema. Your
implementation _is_ your schema!

Read the [blog post](https://jordaneldredge.com/blog/grats).

## Example

Here's what it looks like to define a User type with a greeting field using Grats:

```ts
/** @gqlType */
class User {
  /** @gqlField */
  name: string;

  /** @gqlField */
  greet(args: { greeting: string }): string {
    return `${args.greeting}, ${this.name}`;
  }
}
```

After running `npx grats`, you'll find a `schema.ts` module that exports an executable schema, and a `schema.graphql` file contains your GraphQL schema definition:

```graphql
type User {
  name: String
  greet(greeting: String!): String
}
```

# Types

GraphQL types can be defined by placing a `@gqlType` docblock directly before a:

- Class declaration
- Interface declaration
- Type alias of a literal type or `unknown`

If model your GraphQL resolvers using classes, simply add a `@gqlType` docblock
before the class containing that type's resolvers.

<GratsCode out={TypesClass} mode="ts" />

If your types are represented in your code by TypeScript interfaces, simply add a
`@gqlType` docblock before the interface representing that type. Note that by
using `@gqlType` on an interface, Grats will treat it as a GraphQL type and not
an interface.

<GratsCode out={TypesInterface} mode="ts" />

Finally, if your types are represented in your code by named types, simply add a
`@gqlType` docblock before the type alias which describes that type.

<GratsCode out={TypesAlias} mode="ts" />

## Renaming Types

If you want to use a different name for your type in GraphQL than in your code, you can specify the name of the type in the `@gqlType` docblock tag. See [Renaming](../03-resolvers/04-renaming.mdx) for more information.

<GratsCode out={TypesRenaming} mode="ts" />

Which would extract:

<GratsCode out={TypesRenaming} mode="gql" />

## Operation Types

:::caution
The three operation types, `Query`, `Mutation` and `Subscription` are special and **_must_ be defined as a type alias of of `unknown`**. E.g. `type Query = unknown;`. If you attempt to define them any other way, Grats will report an error. You can read more in this FAQ entry: [Why Prohibit Root Values](../06-faq/06-why-prohibit-root-values.mdx).

## Implementing Interfaces

:::note
Like GraphQL's schema definition language, each type which implements of an interface must manually define all the fields required by the interface with `/** @gqlField */` tags. Grats will not automatically inherit the fields of the interface. If you omit any fields, or fail to match types correctly, Grats will report an error.

### Classes

If you are using classes to model your GraphQL resolvers, you can define your types as implementing a GraphQL interface by declaring that your class `implements` an interface which has been annotated with [`@gqlInterface`](./05-interfaces.mdx).

<GratsCode out={TypesImplementInterface} mode="ts" />

Will generate the following GraphQL schema:

<GratsCode out={TypesImplementInterface} mode="gql" />

### TypeScript Interface

If you are using interfaces to model your GraphQL resolvers, you can define your types as implementing a GraphQL interface by declaring that your class `extends` an interface which has been annotated with [`@gqlInterface`](./05-interfaces.mdx).

<GratsCode out={TypesInterfaceImplementInterface} mode="ts" />

Will generate the following GraphQL schema:

<GratsCode out={TypesInterfaceImplementInterface} mode="gql" />

#### Type Alias

Types declared using a type alias _may not_ implement a GraphQL interface. Instead, we recommend using a TypeScript interface to model your GraphQL type.

See [Interfaces](./05-interfaces.mdx) for more information about defining interfaces.

:::note
If your type implements a GraphQL interface or is a member of a GraphQL
union, Grats will remind you to add a `__typename: "MyType" as const` property to your
class, type or interface.

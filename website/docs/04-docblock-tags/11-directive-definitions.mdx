# Directive Definitions

You can define GraphQL directives by placing a `@gqlDirective` before a:

- Function declaration

<GratsCode out={DirectiveDef} mode="ts" />

While the directive is defined as a function, unlike field resolvers, _Grats will not invoke your function_. However, having a function whose type matches the arguments of your directive can be useful for writing code which will accept the arguments of your directive.

To annotate part of your schema with a directive, see [`@gqlAnnotate`](./12-directive-annotations.mdx).

## Locations

The text after the `@gqlDirective` tag is parsed similarly to a a GraphQL directive definition:

1. An optional name for the directive (the function name will be used if no name is provided)
2. An optional `repeatable` keyword if the directive is repeatable
3. The `on` keyword followed by a list of directive [locations](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#DirectiveLocation) separated by `|`.

<GratsCode out={DirectiveLocations} mode="ts" />

## Arguments

The first argument of the directive function is an object containing the directive’s GraphQL arguments. This mirrors the [Object-style map fields](./03-arguments.mdx#object-map-style-fields) style supported by field resolvers.

_All other arguments to the directive function are ignored by Grats._ This allows the function to be used as part of the implementation of the directive’s behavior.

<GratsCode out={DirectiveArgs} mode="ts" />

Default values in this style can be defined by using the `=` operator with destructuring. Note that you must perform the destructuring in the argument list, not in the function body:

<GratsCode out={DirectiveArgsDefault} mode="ts" />

Arguments can be marked as `@deprecated` by using the `@deprecated` JSDoc tag:

<GratsCode out={DirectiveArgsDeprecated} mode="ts" />

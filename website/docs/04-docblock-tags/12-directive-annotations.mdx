# Directive Annotations

You can annotate constructs in your Grats GraphQL schema with [GraphQL directives](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Language.Directives) using the `@gqlAnnotate` docblock tag.

<GratsCode out={DirectiveAnnotations1} mode="ts" />

Directive annotations can also accept arguments using [GraphQL syntax](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sec-Language.Directives) for arguments:

<GratsCode out={DirectiveAnnotations2} mode="ts" />

:::note
The GraphQL directive `@deprecated` is unique in that it is a built-in GraphQL directive _and_ has a built-in TypeScript equivalent in the form of the `@deprecated` docblock tag. Because of this, TypeScript `@deprecated` docblock tags are automatically converted into GraphQL `@deprecated` directives.

## Directive Validation

While the GraphQL Spec does not actually specify that arguments passed to directives used in the schema should be validated against the types specified in that directive's declaration, **Grats adds its own validation** to ensure that arguments used in `@gqlAnnotate` are typechecked against their directive declaration.

## Schema Directive Annotations at Runtime

Directive annotations added to your schema will be included in Grats' generated `.graphql` file. For directives meant to be consumed by clients or other infrastructure, this should be sufficient.

For directives which are intended to be used during execution, they must be included in the `graphql-js` class `GraphQLSchema` which Grats generates. Unfortunately `GraphQLSchema` does not support a first-class mechanism for including directive annotations. To work around this, **Grats includes directives under as part of the relevant GraphQL class' `extensions` object namespaced under a `grats` key.**

```ts
const foo = {
  extensions: {
    grats: {
      directives: [
        {
          name: "myDirective",
          args: { someArg: "Some Value" },
        },
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

You can find an example of this in action in the [`production-app`](../05-examples/10-production-app.md) example where we define a field directive `@cost` which implements API rate limiting.

# Unions

GraphQL unions can be defined by placing a `@gqlUnion` docblock directly before a:

- Type alias of a union of object types

```ts
// highlight-start
/**
 * A description of my union.
 * @gqlUnion <optional name of the union, if different from type name>
 */
type MyUnion = User | Post;
// highlight-end

/** @gqlType */
class User {
  __typename: "User" as const;
  /** @gqlField */
  name: string;
}

/** @gqlType */
class Post {
  __typename: "Post" as const;
  /** @gqlField */
  content: string;

  /** @gqlField */
  author: User;
}
```

:::note
All the types referenced in the TypeScript union but be explicitly annotated with `@gqlType`. Grats will remind you with a helpful error message if you forget.

:::note
Grats will remind you to add a `__typename: "MyType" as const` property to all the types which are members of a union.

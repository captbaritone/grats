**What if buildng a GraphQL server were as simple as adding annotations to your TypeScript code?**

When you write your GraphQL server in TypeScript, your fields and resolvers are _already_ annotated with type information. _Grats leverages your existing type annotations to extract an executable GraphQL schema from your generic TypeScript resolver code._

By making your TypeScript implementation and its types the source of truth, you never have to worry about validating that your implementation matches your schema. Your implementation _is_ your schema!

## Examples

Grats is flexible enough to work with both class-based and functional approaches to authoring GraphQL types and resolvers.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="oop" label="Classes" default>

```ts
/** @gqlType */
type Query = unknown;

/** @gqlField */
export function me(_: Query): User {
  return new User();
}

/**
 * @gqlField
 * @deprecated Please use `me` instead. */
export function viewer(_: Query): User {
  return new User();
}

/**
 * A user in our kick-ass system!
 * @gqlType */
class User {
  /** @gqlField */
  name: string = "Alice";

  /** @gqlField */
  greeting(salutation: string): string {
    return `${salutation}, ${this.name}`;
  }
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="fp" label="Functional">

```ts
/** @gqlType */
export type Query = {};

/** @gqlField */
export function me(_: Query): User {
  return { name: "Alice" };
}

/**
 * @gqlField
 * @deprecated Please use `me` instead.  */
export function viewer(_: Query): User {
  return { name: "Alice" };
}

/**
 * A user in our kick-ass system!
 * @gqlType */
type User = {
  /** @gqlField */
  name: string;
};

/** @gqlField */
export function greeting(user: User, salutation: string): string {
  return `${salutation}, ${user.name}`;
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Output

Both of the above examples define the following GraphQL schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  me: User
  viewer: User @deprecated(reason: "Please use `me` instead.")
}

"""
A user in our kick-ass system!
"""
type User {
  name: String
  greeting(salutation: String!): String
}
```

## How it works

Grats works as a **build step** which statically analyzes your TypeScript code and generates a TypeScript module defining an executable schema. It also creates a `.graphql` schema file which can be used by clients and other tools.

To tell Grats which parts of your code to expose in the schema, simply annotate them with [docblock tags](../04-docblock-tags/index.md) like `/** @gqlField */`. Grats will scan your code for these tags and use them to automatically build your schema.

:::tip
Docblock tags generally correspond one-to-one with GraphQL schema constructs. You should be able to intuitively add Grats annotations to your code without having to learn a new DSL. If you guess wrong, Grats will let you know with a helpful error message.

For example, in some cases Grats may prompt you to use more explicit type annotations to ensure that it can "see" all the relevant type information.

# Quick Start

This guide will walk you through setting up Grats in a new project.

## Install dependencies

Grats can be used with many different GraphQL servers, but this example uses `graphql-yoga`.

```bash https://docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/code-blocks#npm2yarn-remark-plugin
npm install graphql-yoga
```

```bash
npm install --dev typescript @types/node grats
```

## Initialize TypeScript

Create a `tsconfig.json` in your project root. Note that this config file also contains your Grats config:

```json title="/tsconfig.json"
{
  "grats": {
    // See Configuration for all available options
  },
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "module": "NodeNext"
  }
}
```

## Create your server

```ts title="/server.ts"
import { createServer } from "node:http";
import { createYoga } from "graphql-yoga";
import { getSchema } from "./schema"; // Will be generated by Grats

/** @gqlType */
type Query = unknown;

/** @gqlField */
export function hello(_: Query): string {
  return "Hello world!";
}

const yoga = createYoga({ schema: getSchema() });
const server = createServer(yoga);

server.listen(4000, () => {
  console.log("Running a GraphQL API server at http://localhost:4000/graphql");
});
```

## Build your schema

Next we run Grats to generate our schema. This will create our `./schema.ts` and `./schema.graphql` files.

```bash
npx grats
```

## Start your server

```bash
# Build your project
npx tsc
# Run your server. NOTE: This is the generated `.js` file adjacent to your `.ts` file.
node ./server.js
```

## Execute a query

You should now be able to visit [http://localhost:4000/graphql](http://localhost:4000/graphql) and see the GraphiQL interface! Try running a query:

```graphql
query MyQuery {
  hello
}
```

You should see the following response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "hello": "Hello world!"
  }
}
```

## Success!

If you get stuck while getting started, you can check out our [example projects](../05-examples/index.mdx) for working examples. If that doesn't get you unstuck, stop by our [Discord server](https://capt.dev/grats-chat) to ask for help! We're happy to help you get started.

## Next steps

Once you have Grats working in your code, you can:

- Learn about all the docblock tags that Grats supports in [Docblock Tags](../04-docblock-tags/index.md).
- Read about [Configuration](./03-configuration.md) to learn about all the configuration options available to you.
- Read about [Workflows](../05-guides/01-workflows.md) to learn how to integrate Grats into your development workflows.

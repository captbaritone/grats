# Examples

Working minimal code examples are often the best way to see how a library should be configured. It gives a working starting point that one can borrow from when setting up their own project. To that end, Grats' repository contains a number of examples that demonstrate how to use Grats with various frameworks and libraries. Each example is covered by our integration tests to ensure it's in working order.

## Grats with Other Libraries

- [Apollo Server](./01-apollo-server.md) - A very minimal example of using Grats with Apollo Server.
- [Express GraphQL](./02-express-graphql.md) - Simple demo project integrating Grats, [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [express-graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-graphql).
- [GraphQL HTTP](./03-graphql-http.md) - Simple demo project integrating Grats, [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [graphql-http](https://graphql-http.com/).
- [Yoga](./04-yoga.md) - Simple demo project integrating Grats and [Yoga](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga) with Node's built-in HTTP server. This example also includes an working example of GraphQL subscriptions.
- [NextJS](./08-next-js.md) - Simple demo project integrating Grats and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Yoga](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga).

## Capabilities of Grats

- [Strict Semantic Nullabilty](./09-strict-semantic-nullability.md) - This example demonstrates Grats' experimental support for [Strict Semantic Nullability](https://grats.capt.dev/docs/guides/strict-semantic-nullability).
- [Functions and Mutations](05-functions-mutations.md)
  - Function-based top level fields
  - How to mimic namespaces in a schema
  - Function based mutations
  - Defining the execution's context type and creating it dynamically per-request

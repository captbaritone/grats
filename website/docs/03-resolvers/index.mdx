# Resolvers

Grats leverages [`graphql-js`](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/) for its execution engine, this means each resolver
is passed the [conventional four
arguments](https://graphql.org/learn/execution/#root-fields-resolvers):

### `obj`

The parent object, which for a field on the root Query type is often not used.

:::note
When defining your resolvers as methods on a class, the initial `obj` argument
is omitted in favor of `this`.
:::

When using the functional style, Grats inspects
the type annotation of the first argument to determine which which type this
field is being defined on. In other word, the definition of the type applied to
the `obj` argument must be annotated with `/** @gqlType */`. Grats will report a helpful error if you forget to do this.

### `args`

The arguments provided to the field in the GraphQL query.

Args must be annotated with an **explicit** inline literal type. Grats will
inspect this type declaration to determine the GraphQL type of the expected arguments.

### `context`

A value which is provided to every resolver and holds important contextual information. This generally used for things like:

- Information about the current request
- Context about the currently logged in user
- Per-request caches, such as [DataLoaders](https://github.com/graphql/dataloader)

### `info`

A value which holds field-specific information relevant to the current query as well as the schema details, also refer to type [GraphQLResolveInfo](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlobjecttype) for more details.

This is rarely used, but can be useful for advanced cases such as trying to optimize database queries to perform joins or only fetch the fields that are actually requested.

## Class Method Example

<GratsCode mode="ts" out={ContextMethod} />

## Functional Style Example

:::note
Grats will inspect the type of the first argument in order to determine which GraphQL type the field is being added to.

<GratsCode mode="ts" out={ContextFunction} />

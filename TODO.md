- SDL should extend type for external types - I guess marking types in SDL
- all imported types
- Read SDL to actually do validation
- "modular" mode? like no full schema, but parts of schema but with full validation by resolving it?
- all tests to add fixtures for metadata/resolver map
- pluggable module resolution

- [x] SDL should extend type for external types - I guess marking types in SDL
  - [ ] can't generate graphql-js stuff, don't want to do it for externs - don't support graphql-js for this?
- [ ] all imported types (so support interfaces etc)
- [ ] Read SDL to actually do validation
  - [ ] reenable global validations
- [ ] "modular" mode? like no full schema, but parts of schema but with full validation by resolving it?
- [ ] all tests to add fixtures for metadata/resolver map
- [ ] pluggable module resolution - too many variables there, use filepath by default, let users customize it

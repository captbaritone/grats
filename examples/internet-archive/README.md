# Grats Internet Archive

An in-progress implementation of a GraphQL facade over the [Internet Archive's](https://archive.org) REST API.

Some ideas I'd like to explore in this example:

- [ ] Isomorphism. Can Grats run in the browser and on the server?
- [ ] Grafast. Can we use Grafast's query planing approach with Grats? Can it reduce waterfalls?

## TODO

- [ ] Items should really be an interface that could be a concrete item (is there a name for this?) or a collection.
- [ ] Collections should expose their item properties
- [ ] Top level query fields to get item/collection
- [ ] Type for files
- [ ] Type for user?

## Internet Archive API Documentation

The Internet Archive API is a bit haphazard in how it's documented. Here are some links include relevant information:

/**
 * This API is a GraphQL facade on top of the Internet Archive's existing REST API.
 *
 * Its goal is to improve the developer experience of using the Internet Archive's
 * API by:
 *
 * - Providing a single endpoint for all queries.
 * - Providing a well defined schema that can be used to explore the API and reason about the data it returns.
 *
 * In the future it might also:
 *
 * - Provide an abstraction that can be used client-side in the browser or server-side in Node.js.
 * - Provide a more efficient way to fetch data by leveraging query planing to batch requests or make other optimizations.
 * - Provide a proof of concept to motivate the Internet Archive to build a GraphQL API.

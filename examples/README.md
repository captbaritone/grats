# Grats Example Projects

This directory contains example projects that use Grats. You can read more about them in the [Grats documentation](https://grats.capt.dev/docs/examples/).

## As tests

These examples also operate as integration tests for Grats. You can run them with:

```bash
pnpm run test-example-projects
```

Each project is expected to implement a common schema subset and the integration tests will take the following steps:

0. (Assume the project is already built)
1. Run `pnpm run start` in the project directory
2. Wait for exactly one line of output from the project to signal it's ready
3. Send a series of queries to the project's GraphQL endpoint (default `/graphql` on port 4000)
4. Assert that the responses match the expected output

## `testConfig.json`

Not all servers are identical. To account for this projects can specify how they should be run via a couple methods.

Projects may define a `testConfig.json` file in their root directory. This file should be a JSON object with the following optional properties:

- `port`: The port the project should be run on. Defaults to `4000`.
- `route`: The endpoint the project should be run on. Defaults to `/graphql`.

I could imagine us expanding this to include other configuration options and even additional query/response pairs to test, but for now this is all we need.

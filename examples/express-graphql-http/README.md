# Grats + express + graphql-http

Simple demo project integrating [Grats](https://grats.capt.dev/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/) and [graphql-http](https://graphql-http.com/).

[express-graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-graphql) is deprecated and no longer maintained. [Migrating to graphql-http](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-http#migrating-express-grpahql) is strongly recommended.

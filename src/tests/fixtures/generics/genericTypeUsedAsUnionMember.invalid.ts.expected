-----------------
src/tests/fixtures/generics/genericTypeUsedAsUnionMember.invalid.ts:17:25 - error: Unexpected generic type used as union member. Generic type may not currently be used as members of a union. Grats requires that all union members define a `__typename` field typed as a string literal matching the type's name. Since generic types are synthesized into multiple types with different names, Grats cannot ensure they have a correct `__typename` property and thus cannot be used as members of a union.

src/tests/fixtures/generics/undefinedTypeUsedAsGenericTypeArg.ts:12:15 - error: Unable to resolve type reference. In order to generate a GraphQL schema, Grats needs to determine which GraphQL type is being referenced. This requires being able to resolve type references to their `@gql` annotated declaration. However this reference could not be resolved. Is it possible that this type is not defined in this file?
